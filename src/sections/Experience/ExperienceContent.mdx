### Esvelo / Mobile Engineering Manager
06.2021 - PRESENT

Managing mobile team in the company.
* Defining and managing processes. 
* Conducting One on Oneâ€™s, making sure everyone in the team has what they need.
* Supporting developers in their career paths.
* Creating solutions that simplify the work of the team (technical documentation, new solutions like Bitrise instead of App Center).
* Currently, due to the fact that the company works on crypto projects, I learn the technical aspects in this area (Ethereum blockchain).
